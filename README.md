# Students_Performance
Our task is the exploratory analysis of student performance data on exams, then building some models (linear regression, random forest regression) 
to help us predict student scores
Note: if you want to look at the notebook with the plot graph, you need to go to this page
 https://nbviewer.org/github/gharibMo/Students_Performance/blob/main/Students_Performance.ipynb
 ,because github does not support this library graph view (plotly.express)
